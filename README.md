ðŸŒŸ Full Stack Developer |

ðŸš€ Turning caffeine into code since [Insert Year], Iâ€™m a full-stack Java developer who juggles APIs, databases, and front-end magic like a circus performer on caffeine. From designing pixel-perfect UI to engineering rock-solid back-end systems, I bring ideas to life faster than your browser can refresh.

ðŸ’¡ Skills that pay the bills:
	â€¢	Crafting back-end sorcery with Java
	â€¢	Breeding databases (SQL, MongoDB) in the wild
	â€¢	Front-end tinkering with JavaScript, Angular, React (and occasional arguments with CSS)
	â€¢	Cloud explorer navigating AWS and GCP
	â€¢	Breaking and fixing (mostly fixing) systems with AppDynamics, Splunk, and Jenkins

ðŸŽ¯ Special abilities:
	â€¢	Debugging code at warp speed
	â€¢	Packing logic bombs in functions for elegance (and chaos)
	â€¢	Automating the boring stuff (so I can binge-read my Books guilt-free)

ðŸ›  When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me:
	â€¢	Geeking out on AI and big data
  â€¢	Reading books 
	â€¢	Strategizing on how to optimize my caffeine-to-commit ratio
	â€¢	Daydreaming about building the next billion-dollar app
